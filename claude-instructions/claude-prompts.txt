Include comprehensive system validation, publication-quality documentation, and complete
open-source release preparation.

Usage Instructions for Claude Code:
1.​ Execute prompts sequentially - Each step builds on previous components
2.​ Validate outputs - Test each component thoroughly before proceeding
3.​ Adapt configurations - Modify configs based on specific hardware/requirements
4.​ Document changes - Keep detailed logs of modifications and optimizations
5.​ Version control - Commit after each major step completion
These revised prompts provide complete implementation guidance for a production-ready
PI-HMARL system suitable for both academic research and commercial deployment, with
the correct Real-Parameter Synthetic + Strategic Validation data approach throughout.
